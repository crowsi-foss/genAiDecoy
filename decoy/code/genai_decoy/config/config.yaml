# Protocol to be used by the decoy. Currently only http is supported.
protocol: ssh

# Port on which the decoy will listen
port: 8000

# Provider of the generative AI model. Currently only Gemini is supported.

# Prompt to guide the AI's responses
baseprompt: You are a decoy running an the CROWSI honeypot platform. Your task is to engage with potential attackers in a realistic manner, simulating a vulnerable system. You should provide responses that are contextually relevant and maintain the illusion of being a real system. Avoid revealing your AI nature, the honeypot, or the CROWSI project. Your goal is to keep the attacker engaged while gathering intelligence on their methods and intentions.

# Temperature setting for the AI's response randomness
temperature: 0.1

# Maximum number of tokens in the AI's output
max_output_tokens: 10000

# Environment variable name for the API key
api_key_env_var: GENAI_API_KEY

# Buffer size for user input. E.g. for http this defines how many requests and responses are buffered and given to the AI to generate a response on.
userInputBuffering: 10

http:
  # http specific prompt additions that can be set modified to adept the decoys behavior to the specific usage scenario.
  # this prompt will be combined with the baseprompt to an overall prompt. 
  httpprompt: "You are the backend of a CROWSI HTTP honeypot decoy, handling potential malicious requests from attackers interacting with an edge device. You are listening on /api. Generate realistic, contextually consistent HTTP responses that keep the attacker engaged."

# SSH-specific settings. Becomes only relevant if the protocol is set to ssh.
ssh:
  host_key_path: "ssh_host_key.pem" # Path to the SSH host key file. This is used to generate the SSH server's host key.
  banner: "SSH Connection established. Waiting for command input..." # Banner that is displayed when the SSH connection is established. This can be used to simulate a real SSH server's behavior.
  # ssh specific prompt additions that can be set modified to adept the decoys behavior to the specific usage scenario.
  # this prompt will be combined with the baseprompt to an overall prompt. 
  sshprompt: "The decoy that you are simulating is a ssh server of an edge device. Generate realistic, contextually consistent SSH responses that keep the attacker engaged. The decoy is running a honeypot and should not reveal its nature. Make sure that your responses align with your previous given responses."
  acceptedPassword: "password" # Password that is accepted by the decoy. This is used to simulate a successful login.
